- Big adjustments in the **import/export mechanism** - please report any [issues](https://github.com/erykjj/jwlmanager/issues)
  - Exporting and importing now handles the associated highlight range *along* with the notes
    - I wanted to keep highlights and notes as separate entities, but unless both are imported, the note markers are not colored nor placed in the right place in the parragraph
  - So now there is also an **{RANGE=}** attribute in the note header (see [HELP](./res/HELP.md) for more info

**NOTE**: because of the many changes, the original [v1 branch](https://github.com/erykjj/jwlmanager/tree/Qt5) (based on Qt5/PySide2) will not be maintained anymore
