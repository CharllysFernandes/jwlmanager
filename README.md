# JWLManager - v2[^#]
**Looking for help with translation on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/jwlmanager/)**[^*]   ![Translation status](https://hosted.weblate.org/widgets/jwlmanager/-/qt-ui/88x31-black.png)

## Purpose

This is a **multi-platform application** for viewing and performing various operations on the *user* data stored in a *.jwlibrary* backup archive (created from within the **JW Library** app[^1]: Personal Study > Backup and Restore > Create a backup). A modified *.jwlibrary* archive can then be restored within the app.

In addition to the main functions of **viewing, exporting, importing, and deleting**, the application can also clean up any residual/unused records from the database and re-index the various tables within the database. Items from different backups can be **merged** by exporting the desired items and importing them into an existent archive or into a new one.

## Usage

### Windows 10/11 and macOS 11+

Simply [download](https://github.com/erykjj/jwlmanager/releases/latest) and launch the latest **Windows executable** or **macOS app**.

**Notes**
- If you receive **Windows Defender "unknown publisher" alerts**, you can safely choose "More info" and "Run anyway". See [here](https://github.com/erykjj/jwlmanager/issues/1) for a discussion on what's going on.
- The macOS app is slow to start up. I'm looking into it.

### Linux

[Download](https://github.com/erykjj/jwlmanager/releases/latest) and extract the latest release source code; then execute to run (from inside JWLManager folder):

```
$ python3 JWLManager.py
```

Or, make it executable first and run directly:

```
$ chmod +x JWLManager.py
$ ./JWLManager.py
```

You *may* have to install some of the required libraries[^2]. Do [let me know](https://github.com/erykjj/jwlmanager/issues) if you have any difficulties ;-)

If you use the -h flag, you'll see the following options:

```
usage: JWLManager.py [-h] [-v] [-en | -es | -fr]

Manage .jwlibrary backup archives

options:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -v, --version  show version and exit

interface language:
  -en or leave out for English

  -en            English (default)
  -es            Spanish (español)
  -fr            French (français)
```

Which means that (on all platforms) you can launch the GUI in the desired language by appending the corresponding language code parameter. So, if you want to start the app in Spanish (instead of the default English), you would invoke it as...
- Linux terminal: `python3 JWLManager.py -es`
- Windows Comand Prompt (or shortcut): `JWLManager.exe -es`
- macOS Terminal: `open -a JWLManager.app --args -es`
